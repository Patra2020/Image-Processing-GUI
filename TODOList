-Smoothing (with level/slide bar) using a convolution kernel?

-Sharpening (with level/slide bar) using a convolution kernel?

-Ruler (users can draw a line but they have to give the scale information => 1 pixel equal to ... micrometer)
DONE
-Zoom (using interpolation upsampling, but the picture is also able to be shifted)
DONE 

-Angle measurement (draw a line and the compare it to the horizontal/vertical axis to get the angle value)
DONE
-Edge detection (canny, perewitt, Sobel)
DONE

-Negative image
DONE
-Image normalization
DONE -- thik karna hai
-High pass filter (Fourier)
DONE
-Low pass filter (Fourier)
DONE
-Multi object segmentation (via template matching) can also be used for cell/object counting. The template can be generated trough mouse click and drag over the image

-Realtime object tracking (optional but Prof. Andreas will be like to see this) for the simple approach, just used the template matching

-3 empty buttons which will be used later.
